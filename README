A very simple icon theme designed to be distraction-free
and look uniform. It has a small set of colours, with one
one being regularly used. The colours are customisable via
config.mk.

Design:

•	Icons should be in SVG, 16 by 16 pixels

•	Icons should be optimised for 16 by 16 pixels

•	Gaps between objects should be 1 pixel

•	The base colour should be #bebebe

•	Transparency should be used instead of colours
	and shades, primarily 25% opaque and secondarily
	50% opaque, unless not appropriate

•	In exceptional cases colours can be used:

	Status indication:
	•	Red    = #ef2929ff (critical state or missing)
	•	Orange = #f57900ff (warning)
	•	Green  = #32a679ff (verified)

	User selectable colours:
	•	Red     = #cd656cff
	•	Orange  = #d69553ff
	•	Yellow  = #ccad47ff
	•	Green   = #32a679ff
	•	Cyan    = #00a09fff
	•	Blue    = #2495beff
	•	Magenta = #a46eb0ff

•	Icons that can be overlayed, such as emblems,
	should have a 1 pixel black (#000000) outline

•	SVG files should be cleaned up with `svgcleaner`

When building, it is a good idea to run `make all-fast -j`
rather than `make all -j` or `make -j` (also if without -j).
